# Source-Engine-Mapadd-Implementation
This is an implementation of a txt file scripting system for the source engine. In the future i will add a readme to the file mapadd to give a guide on how to use the mapadd. but for now if you know how to program you will understand this code. This was inspired by the smod mapadd. Place these files into the server side of a source 2013 project
